Pantheon Professional Services (**PS**) and Onboarding teams work closely with partners to provide customized solutions for the most complex technical challenges and ensure your success on Pantheon. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Onboarding

Pantheon Onboarding Managers (**OM**) are your website operations (WebOps) experts, to help facilitate a successful launch and ensure your team has the knowledge and tools to deliver value fast. Our Onboarding team stays with you for up to 90 days to make sure your team has the WebOps tools and training to work effectively on the Pantheon platform.

### Pantheon Secure Integration

Provides a static outgoing IP address for use in IP whitelisting connections to external services. [Learn more about Secure Integration](/secure-integration) or [contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

### SSO/SAML

Single Sign-on to the Pantheon Dashboard. [Learn more about SSO for Organizations](/sso-organizations) or [contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

### Custom SSL Certificates

If a Custom SSL Certificate is mission critical to your web property, you can bring your own custom certificate to the platform. [Learn more about Custom Certificates](/custom-certificates) or [contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

### Pre-launch Load Testing

Load tests can be critical steps in ensuring a successful launch. Using proprietary tools developed by the ON team we generate traffic to your Live site, simulating complex user interactions if needed. There is no better way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before you’ve launched your site.

Load tests provide critical insight for how a site will perform in the wild and through peak traffic spikes. Load tests ensure that your website launches smoothly and that it is ready to absorb the high traffic that success brings. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Professional Services

### Site Migrations

The Site Migration service lowers the barrier to entry by leveraging our PS team and partners. Whether you are moving one or hundreds of sites to or within Pantheon, Pantheon Migration Services will help you get it done quickly and reliably.

**What does a site migration entail?**

- **Qualification**: We get access to the servers or site archives we'll need to undertake the migration and identify business critical functionality that require special attention and testing.
- **Initial migration**: We use automated tools and processes to move code, databases and files, and to stand-up your new environments on Pantheon.
- **Test and patch**: We fine-tune the migration routine to ensure that everything is working as expected, supported by Visual Regression tools, and build out additional scripting and automated testing as needed. This provides a repeatable and auditable process, and enables pre-launch content syncing.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: You test the site yourself. We have mechanisms in place to report any issues that are found and we work to resolve those issues.
- **Launch Planning**: We work with your team to coordinate launch planning, including content resyncs, load testing, SSL certificate pre-provisioning, and more.
- **Launch**: Our team stands by during the DNS cutover to handle any potential migration issues and we stick around post-launch.

## Managed Updates

Pantheon's [Managed Updates](/managed-updates) service keeps your site up to date with minimal interruption to end users. Allow Pantheon’s PS team to apply core and contributed plugin/module updates.

Your Engagement Manager monitors the process and works with you to ensure that updates are being applied cleanly and tested, minimizing interference with your day-to-day operations.

**Managed updates process overview:**

- Updates are detected per client-provided specifications.
- A Multidev environment is spun up, cloning DB/files from Live.
- Updates are applied to the Multidev environment and Visual Regression Tests (**VRT**) are run.
- Manual testing if required.
- If VRT passes, we merge the Multidev branch into Master and run VRT again.
- Repeat same process on Test.
- Back up Live environment and deploy updates to Live.

### Advanced Global CDN

Implement additional services like IP-based geolocation, extended WAF, Image Optimization, and Domain Masking using our [Advanced Global CDN](/advanced-global-cdn) implementation.

**Advanced Global CDN process overview:**

- **Qualification**: A member of the PS team works with your technical team to assess your needs and determine if your business requirements can be served with Advanced Global CDN.
- **Scoping**: We work with your team to determine areas of responsibility for both PS and your team and to set timelines for the start and completion of work.
- **Configuration**: PS sets up your site(s) and configures both the Advanced Global CDN service and your CMS.
- **Launch**: We provide you with the information you will need to launch or re-launch your site on Advanced Global CDN.
- **Post-Launch**: PS provides up to four hours per quarter to address requests and changes to the Advanced Global CDN service throughout the lifetime of the contract.
