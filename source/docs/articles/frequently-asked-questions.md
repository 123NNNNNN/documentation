<!-- This begins the code for the question "How does Pantheon work with DNS?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#dns" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="dns">
How does Pantheon work with DNS?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="dns">
  <div class="well">
  Pantheon can handle any internet domain name you point at it. DNS configuration is still your responsibility at this time, but our <a href="/docs/articles/going-live">going live</a> instructions provide you with the necessary IP addresses and/or CNAME records to configure with your DNS provider.<br /><br />
  In order for your site to begin "listening" for your domain, you must first become a paying customer. We consider placing a real domain on on a site to be the point at which the site starts to go live.

<!-- This begins the code for the question "Can I use my own git repository (e.g github)?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">

<!-- This begins the code for the question "Does Pantheon Support Drupal Multisite?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#drupalmultisite" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="drupalmultisite">
Does Pantheon Support Drupal Multisite?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="drupalmultisite">
  <div class="well">
  No. Pantheon's architecture is designed to provide high performance and a rich feature set for individual Drupal sites. There are inherent risks when running multisite. Individual sites can end up in states of configuration that make module or Drupal core updates impossible to do across all the sites. The codebase also becomes a single point of failure.<br /><br />
  Our solution is to deliver granular resources and powerful code management tools so that users who want to run a large portfolio of sites can do so easily, without running the risks inherent in multisite.

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#drush" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="drush">
Does Pantheon support Drush?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="drush">

Does Pantheon support local development?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="localdev">

  Yes. Local development is a great best practice, and Pantheon supports a wide array of local development tools (e.g. MAMP, WAMP, Homebrew, etc).

<!-- This begins the code for the question "How does cron work on Pantheon?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#cron" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cron">
How does cron work on Pantheon?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="cron">
  <div class="well">
  The plafrorm will use drush to run cron on an hourly basis automatically. More fine-tuned cron control is in development. If you need to run cron more frequently, you are free to do so using your own timing system and drush aliases.

<!-- This begins the code for the question "Does Pantheon Have FTP or Shell access?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#shell" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="shell">
Does Pantheon Have FTP or Shell access?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="shell">
  <div class="well">
  Pantheon supports toggling between local development mode using <code>git push</code> to transfer all code changes, and an on-server development mode, which provides access to the codebase via SFTP.<br /><br />

  Direct SSH access is not supported, but you are able to directly interface with mysql, use drush, and SFTP files. Rsync is currently unstable on Pantheon. The engineering team is at work to improve its functionality on the platform.

<!-- This begins the code for the question "How do I increase the maximum execution time limit for a PHP script?"-->
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
<h4><a data-toggle="collapse" style="cursor:pointer" data-target="#maximumexecution" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="maximumexecution">
How do I increase the maximum execution time limit for a PHP script?</a></h4>
<div class="collapse" id="maximumexecution">

  The best way to do this by calling the PHP function <code>set_time_limit()</code> in your routine that takes more time. See the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php">Function reference</a> for more details.
