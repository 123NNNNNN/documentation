Organizations on Pantheon bring together users, sites, custom upstreams, unified support, and Multidev to provide administrators with the tools needed to effectively manage a large number of websites.

## Organization Types

Organizations are available to three types of customers.

1. Partner Agencies
2. Enterprises
3. Reseller

## Custom Upstreams

Upstreams are git forks of Pantheon's versions of Drupal and WordPress, owned and managed by organizations. They are available for all members of the organization to select when starting a new site. Reseller partners customers deliver SAAS products built with Drupal or WordPress, automatically creating a new site for each of their clients. Learn all about [custom upstreams](/docs/articles/organizations/running-a-custom-upstream).

## Multidev

All organizations have multidev available on every site. Please submit a ticket from a site dashboard to activate multidev. Once active, sites receive five Cloud Development Environments (CDE's) and unlimited git branches, from which CDE's can be created on-demand. Learn how to [use Multidev]().

## Access the Pantheon One Dashboard
Access organization dashboards from the User Dashbaord in the Organizations tab, between the site name and service level in an org-associated site dashboard, or in the sites list by using the keyboard shortcut, "s".
