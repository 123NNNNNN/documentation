Completely deleting your Pantheon account requires three major steps:

## 1. Backup and Export Your Sites

The first thing to do is to backup and export your sites. Yes, you are leaving the platform, but you should always have a backup of your work just in case.

If you need to make a backup of an existing environment, see [Backup Creations](/docs/articles/sites/backups/backup-creation#steps).

For more information about exporting a backup of an environment, see the [Restoring a Backup](/docs/articles/sites/backups/restoring-an-environment-from-a-backup) document.

## 2. Delete Each of Your Sites

Once you have backed-up your data and are ready to delete your sites, see the [Deleting a Site](/docs/articles/sites/deleting-a-site) document in the wiki. It is a simple one-click operation, but it is **_permanent_** . Don't worry. You will be prompted to confirm before the deletion occurs.

## 3. Delete Your Credit Cards

The next step is to delete the associated credit cards. For more information, see the [Removing a Credit Card](/docs/articles/sites/removing-a-credit-card#delete-your-card) document.

## 4. Delete Your Account

After you have completed the steps above go to your account dashboard, Account, Delete Account. Click the red **Delete Account** button, enter the verification text and confirm.
