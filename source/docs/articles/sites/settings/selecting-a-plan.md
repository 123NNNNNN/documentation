## Overview
Pantheon offers multiple service levels, called [Plans](https://www.getpantheon.com/pricing). You can select the plan that works best for you and your needs. As you grow you can start on the Basic Plan. The once you start to grow and have more specific requirements, you can take a look at the Pro Plan, which can be part of the recipe to get your site or application scale and perform better.

## Select a Site

To get started, pick a plan by selecting the site you would like to associate with a plan.

## Select the Site Settings

After you get to your site's dashboard, click the **Settings** link in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace.


## Add a Payment Method

If you have already added a card to your account you can select the card you would like to use for billing, or if you need to add a payment method, you can do so from the same section.

**Note**: You won't be able to select a plan until you've associated a payment method with the site; e.g. selecting a card from the drop-down list & clicking _Update Payment Method_.
