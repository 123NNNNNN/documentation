## Overview
Pantheon offers multiple service levels, called [Plans](https://www.getpantheon.com/pricing). You can select the plan that works best for you and your needs. As you grow you can start on the Basic Plan. The once you start to grow and have more specific requirements, you can take a look at the Pro Plan, which can be part of the recipe to get your site or application scale and perform better.


To get started, select the site you would like to associate with a plan.


## Choose a Plan and Add a Payment Method

1. Select **Billing**, and choose the plan you want for the selected site.

2. Add a payment method or invite the site owner to pay for the site.  If you have already added a card to your account, you can select the card you want to use for billing.  
**Note**: You won't be able to select a plan until you've associated a payment method with the site.
3. Once this is done an email will be sent to the account of the user who is associated with the credit card.
