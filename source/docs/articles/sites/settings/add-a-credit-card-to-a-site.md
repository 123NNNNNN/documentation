  After you've selected a plan, you'll get access to additional features like adding a custom domain name to your site, or for Pro accounts and higher, adding SSL and more. For more details on plans and features, see [Pricing](https://pantheon.io/pricing).

## Accessing Premium Features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team Management, and New Relic can all be accessed for free; however, there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when adding SSL you will be prompted to update your site's plan:  


 ![To enable SSL - choose at least a Pro plan](https://www.getpantheon.com/sites/default/files/docs/desk_images/309237)


Clicking the message will take you to the Settings page to either select a plan or proceed to Billing to enter your billing information.

<!--<p><strong>NOTE: In order to change the actively billed card for a specific site, you will need already have <a href="http://helpdesk.getpantheon.com/customer/portal/docs/articles/688411-adding-a-credit-card-to-your-account">a card associated with your user account.</a> If you do not have a credit card on your account you will not have a payment method available in the dropdown.</strong></p>-->
