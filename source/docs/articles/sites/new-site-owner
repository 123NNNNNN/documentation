####How do I add and remove team members?

**Add a Team Member**

In the Team modal, enter the email address of the user, and click **Add team member**.

Once the user has been added to the project, they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase, create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content, and perform updates.

**Remove a Team Member**

**Note**: All users can be removed except the site owner.

In the Team modal, click the X next to the user you want to delete.

When you delete a user from a site, they lose the ability to perform any operations on that site.

####Can I transfer ownership of a site to someone else?

The site owner is the person who pays for the site. You'll need to update the payment method in order to change the owner.

1. Click **Invite a business owner to pay for this site** within in the Settings page of the Site Dashboard.
2. Enter the email address for the new site owner and select the applicable plan for the site.
  Once the new owner receives the invitation, they will be directed to provide payment information, at which point they will assume ownership of the site.

Enterprise Organizations can use the same process to assume ownership of a site; however, Agency Partners do not have the ability to own sites directly.

For Sandbox sites, the site owner can click **Team**, then click **Make Owner** next to the team member who should receive ownership of the site.
