When you become a site owner, you receive administrator permissions to manage the billing information, team members, and site settings.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Billing Tasks


####How do I change site service levels?
From your Site Dashboard, click  **Billing**. Select **Change Plan**, choose the new plan and payment information, and click **Purchase Plan**.

####Can I update or change the payment method?
You can update the payment method in the **Billing** page. For detailed instructions, see [Updating Payment Methods](source/docs/articles/updating-payment-methods/).


####Can I transfer ownership of a site to someone else?

The site owner is the person who pays for the site. You'll need to update the payment method in order to change the owner.

1. From the **Billing** page, click **Invite to pay for the site**.
2. Enter the email address for the new site owner, and click **Send Invite**.
  Once the new owner receives the invitation, they will be directed to provide payment information, at which point they will assume ownership of the site.

Enterprise Organizations can use the same process to assume ownership of a site; however, Agency Partners do not have the ability to own sites directly.

For Sandbox sites, the site owner can click **Team**, then click **Make Owner** next to the team member who should receive ownership of the site.



### Administrative Tasks


####How do I enable add-ons?
From your Site Dashboard, click **Settings**, then click **Add Ons**. You will now see all the available add ons available for your site.

**Note**: Only enable SSL for your Live environment. It is not needed in Dev or Test.



####How do I add and remove team members?

**Add a Team Member**

In the Team modal, enter the email address of the user, and click **Add team member**.

Once the user has been added to the project, they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase, create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content, and perform updates.

**Remove a Team Member**

**Note**: All users can be removed except the site owner.

In the Team modal, click the X next to the user you want to delete.

When you delete a user from a site, they lose the ability to perform any operations on that site.


####Can I downgrade my site to a personal plan?
Yes. However, if you have Solr and/or Redis add ons enabled, they will break when you go down to personal plan level.
