Pantheon has powerful workflow tools that are packed with real-time features that are great for people working in teams, and getting started is easy and simple.

## Team Management
You can add and delete users in the Team modal. Simply click Team located in the upper-right of your Dashboard.

## Add a Team Member

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Enter the email address of the user, and click **Add team member**.


Once the user has been added to the project, they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase, create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content, and perform updates.

## Invite a Team Member

Sometimes you need to invite a user to a team or project who does not have a Pantheon account. You can still add them to the project and they will be sent with an invite to become a team member on the site.

Once they have successfully signed up for an account, they will be automatically added to the team. As an added bonus if the user signs up, you get an extra free Dev site to spin up!


## Remove a Team Member

**Note**: All users can be removed except the site owner.

Remove a user by clicking **Team**, and then click the X next to the user you want to delete.

When you delete a user from a site, they lose the ability to perform any operations on that site.

## Site Owner
If there is another person (e.g. client, manager, accountant, or developer) who has the payment information, you can add them as a team member and they can add their own card data and associate it with your site. The person paying for a site is considered the "owner" and cannot be removed from the site team.

### Change the Site Owner

The owner of a site can be changed in a few simple steps:

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Select **Make Owner** next to the team member that should receive ownership of the site.

The new site owner now has the ability to add a credit card or change the site plan.

### Pantheon Partners
The site owner is the person who pays for the site. You'll need to update the payment method to change the owner.

## Add a Supporting Organization

One of the best things about Pantheon is the ability to collaborate with agencies and shops on web projects. If you have contracted with a Pantheon Partner or Ally Agency, you can add them to the site as a _supporting organization_, which will give their company access to help build, launch, or maintain your site.

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Click **Add Supporting Organization** at the bottom of the team management window.
3. Enter the complete name of the agency. An exact match is required.
4. Check that the agency is the one you expected.
5. Click the **Add Agency** button to make them a supporting organization.

**Note:** Because supporting organizations have full access to a site, only the site owner can perform this action.
