# Image management

Images must be located inside of this directory, no matter the location of the document or documents that contain them. 
## Image naming convention

Name your image following this pattern: `env-tool-location-action.png`
For instance, an image representing committing code in the dev environment should be named: 
`dev-code-pendingchanges-commit.png` 

![Commit pending changes to dev environment](/source/assets/images/dev-code-pendingchanges-commit.png "Commit pending changes to the dev environment") 

## Embedding images

`![Pantheon Fistbump](/source/assets/images/pantheon-fistbump.png "Pantheon Fistbump")` will yield

![Pantheon Fistbump](/source/assets/images/pantheon-fistbump.png "Pantheon Fistbump")
