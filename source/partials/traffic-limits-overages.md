## Traffic Limits and Overages

Pantheon optimizes the resources and performance of your site based on your choice of [pricing plan](https://pantheon.io/pricing-comparison?docs). Your pricing plan determines the [backend resources](/platform-resources#platform-resources) Pantheon deploys to support site performance and to serve the corresponding traffic levels for each plan. Customers should choose the plan that suits their anticipated traffic and continually monitor that choice using [Pantheon's Site Dashboard](/metrics).

As your site grows on Pantheon, you are able to modify your plan based on the metrics you find in the Site Dashboard. If your traffic is continually over your plan limit, we may automatically adjust you to a pricing plan that better aligns with your traffic growth. This is important to ensure the continued performance of all sites on Pantheon, and to avoid any negative impact to your site as traffic levels change.

Pantheon monitors your site traffic as part of our evaluation of overall site health. To understand the limits associated with your pricing plan, visit the [pricing comparison page](https://pantheon.io/pricing-comparison?docs) for additional information.

### Overage Protection

Pantheon designed Overage Protection for Performance sites to prevent one-time traffic spikes from causing billing issues. All Performance plans and higher include Overage Protection, which provides billing protection against externally driven spikes, or for businesses that have an annual “big event” but otherwise operate at a lower “normal” rate.

If the change to traffic behavior exceeds your plan limit for any two months of traffic, your site will be moved to the next appropriate plan to help avoid further overages. You will receive notifications of this change ahead of time.

### Basic Plans

Basic plan sites do not have this protective feature and are automatically upgraded to the appropriate [Performance plan](https://pantheon.io/plans/performance-pricing).
