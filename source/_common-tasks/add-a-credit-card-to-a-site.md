### Accessing Premium Features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team Management, and New Relic can all be accessed for free; however, there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when adding SSL you will be prompted to update your site's plan:

Clicking the message will take you to the Settings page to either select a plan or proceed to Billing to enter your billing information.
