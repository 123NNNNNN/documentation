<h2>Assessing Alerts</h2>
<p>Services like Pingdom  or New Relic Synthetics periodically reach out to sites with ping or HTTP requests to gauge availability. These types of tests can create false positives for a number of reasons, including:</p>

<h3>Internet Routing</h3>
<p>A temporary routing issue between a particular monitoring service endpoint and one of our CDN Points of Presence (POPs) can result in an alert. The internet is a big place, and there's a lot of potential for intermittent packet loss between any two points, depending in the route taken. A single loss of access from one point to another does not always correlate to an issue with the site itself.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR_(software)" class="external">MTR</a> can help to diagnose a routing issue.</p>

<h3>Idle Containers</h3>
<p>As we discuss in our doc <a href="/docs/application-containers/#idle-containers">All About Application Containers</a>, containers will spin down after approximately twelve hours of idle time (for a live environment on a paid plan). A web request will trigger a "wake up" on the environment, which usually occurs within 30 seconds. Monitoring pings sent between the initial request and the completed spin-up may fail, but do not necessarily indicate an issue.</p>
