## Authenticating

### SSH Keys
To take full advantage of Pantheon, you should load your public SSH key into your account. SSH keys are a best practice for authentication, allowing you more security than a simple password. You will only need to do this once, no matter how many sites you work on. For more details, see [Generate and Add SSH Keys](/docs/ssh-keys/).

### Dashboard Credentials
If you are prompted for a password when connecting to the platform, use your **Pantheon Dashboard** login password to gain access.

Larger agencies with multiple developers using password authentication who login frequently may see access issues across the organization. To avoid potential authentication failures, we strongly recommend using SSH keys.
