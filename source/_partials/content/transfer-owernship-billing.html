<p>This is the most common way agencies handle billing. The invitation will guide the recipient through adding their payment method to the site for the designated plan.</p>
<p>The user who pays for the site becomes the site owner. Agencies maintain access by being associated as a Supporting Organization.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
  <p>We recommend communicating with the business owner well in advance of sending an invitation. It's a good idea to have them notify you once they've upgraded so you can continue the going live procedure. Feel free to share the <a href="/docs/site-owner-faq/">Site Owner FAQ</a> guide with them.</p>

 <li>Ask the new site owner to add your agency as a <a href="/docs/team-management/#add-a-supporting-organization">Supporting Organization</a> so you can continue the going live procedure on their behalf.</li>
