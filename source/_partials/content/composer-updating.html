  <p>As packages pulled by Composer are updated (along with their dependencies), version compatibility issues can pop up. `composer.lock` prevents the updating of packages beyond the version limits specified within, and need to be manually reviewed/updated from time to time. See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions" class="external">updating dependencies</a> section of Composer's documentation for more information.</p>
