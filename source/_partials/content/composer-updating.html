  <p>As packages pulled by Composer are updated (along with their dependencies), version compatibility issues can pop up. Sometimes you may need to manually alter the version constraints on a given package within the `require` or `require-dev` section of `composer.json` in order to update packages. See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions" class="external">updating dependencies</a> section of Composer's documentation for more information.</p>
