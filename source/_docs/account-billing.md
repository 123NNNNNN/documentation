The Billing tab within the Account tool of the User Dashboard shows credit card profiles for sites you've launched on Pantheon. Each profile shows the site(s) using the card as the current payment method, as configured in the Site Dashboard.

## Access Billing
1. Go to the User Dashboard and select **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Account**.
2. Click the **Billing** tab.

### Roles & Permissions
The permission to manage credit cards and view billing history (invoices and transactions) is granted only to the role of **Site Owners** at the site-level. You can see who is assigned this role by clicking **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team** in the Site Dashboard. Other roles do not have access to billing as described on this page.
