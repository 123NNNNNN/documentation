The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file is used when working with [Custom Upstreams](/docs/custom-upstream/). It contains default values for the configuration settings stored in the `pantheon.yml` file. This upstream file may contain any of the settings described in the [Advanced Configuration](/docs/pantheon-yml/#advanced-site-configuration) section of the [pantheon.yml file documentation](/docs/pantheon-yml); it cannot define any Quicksilver workflows. If a property such as `php_version` is defined in ths upstream, then its value will be used only for sites that do not define the same property in their `pantheon.yml` file.

The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file should only be edited in the upstream repository where it is defined. See the [Create a Custom Upstream](/docs/create-custom-upstream) documentation for information on how to set up an upstream. Similarly, an upstream should not define a `pantheon.yml` file; it should place all configuration settings in the upstream file instead. Keeping the configuration settings defined by the upstream in a separate file form the configuration settings that are specific to the site prevents merge conflicts when an upstream needs to change its default pantheon configuration.

To avoid accidentally changing a `pantheon.upstream.yml` file in a Pantheon site, it is recommended that upstream repositories that contain this file should also list it in the upstream's `.gitignore` file. When editing the file in the upstream, it is necessary to force-add it prior to committing with git:

```bash
$ git add -f pantheon.upstream.yml
$ git commit -n "Change the default php version for this upstream to 7.0"
```

### Example File Contents

The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file should contain default content similar to the example file shown below:
```yaml
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Do not edit this file unless you are doing so in your custom upstream repository.
# Override the defaults specified here in a site-specific `pantheon.yml` file.
# For more information see: https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-upstream-yml
api_version: 1
php_version: 7.0
```
