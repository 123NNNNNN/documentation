Welcome!

This guide is here to help you get a WooCommerce store up and running on Pantheon. In this guide you'll learn how to:

* Create a site on Pantheon and install WooCommerce
* Commit your changes with version control
* Move your dev site to a live environment
* Accept orders on your live site and pull your database to your test and dev environments for future changes.

Before we get going it's important you already have a <a href="https://pantheon.io/register" target="_blank">Pantheon account <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt"></span></a> (they're free!) and you already know how to [create a site](/docs/guides/quickstart/create-new-site/).
