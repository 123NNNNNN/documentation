In order to launch your store and add a custom domain you'll need a paid [Pantheon Plan](/docs/site-plan/). Once you have upgraded to a paid Pantheon plan you can follow these instructions to [point your DNS and launch](/docs/guides/launch/).

Now that you are on a paid plan don't forget to [enable automatic backups](/docs/guides/launch/launch-check/).

Now that your store is really live you can start marketing and prepare for the incoming orders!
