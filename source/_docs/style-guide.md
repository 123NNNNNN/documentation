### New Terms

### Code Snippets Commands & Variables

## Callouts and Tabs

### Notes

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4><p markdown="1">For optimal use of this document, consider viewing the markdown file and rendered page in Sculpin side-by-side. Any important points the customer needs to be made aware of can be put in a note like this.

Some General Rules

- [Avoid be verbs](http://writing.rocks/to-be-or-not-to-be/)
 - Avoid colloquialisms and personal opinions, feelings, or anecdotes.
 - Only assume as much knowledge from the reader as specified in [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin). Otherwise explain everything.
 - Notice the `draft: true` line in this template's header? If keeps this page from being visible in the live site. Be sure to remove it from your doc.

## Terminal and Code Blocks
