## Available Metrics
Metrics include **visits** and **pages served** for the site's Live environment, with data refreshed daily.
<dl>
  <dt>Visits</dt>
    <dd>Total amount of unique traffic (IP and user agent) to your site in a 24 hour period, excluding known bots and crawlers.</dd>
  <dt>Pages Served</dt>
    <dd>Total number of responses generated by WordPress or Drupal that is served to a visitor. This includes cached responses and non-HTML responses such as JSON.</dd>
</dl>
For example, imagine two visitors go to `example.com`. The first visitor exits from the home page, but the second visitor continues to browse two additional pages. This would be tracked as 2 visits and 4 pages served.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How often is data collected?
Data is updated daily around midnight UTC. If your site is not yet on the Global CDN data will not be available.

### How long do you keep the data?
Data is retained for the following amounts of time:

| Period  | Data Retention |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Day     | 28 days        |
| Week    | 12 weeks       |
| Month   | 12 months      |

### Can I download or access the raw data directly?
Raw data is not currently available.

### Why does't Pantheon's traffic match my analytics?
There are some inherent limitations with using an analytics suite (e.g. Google Analytics) when measuring site traffic. For details, see [Pageview Limits and Overages](/docs/pageview-limits/#why-doesnt-pantheons-traffic-match-my-analytics).

### How does Pantheon handle overages?
Where there is a pattern of consistent overage, we will align a site's plans with its load on the platform. For details, see [Pageview Limits and Overages](/docs/pageview-limits/#does-pantheon-charge-for-overages).

### What about bots or DoS attacks?
Self-identified bots are excluded from the Visits and Pages Served Metrics.

### Can I see metrics on other environments?
Metrics are currently only available for the Live environment.

### Can I check metrics from the command line with Terminus?
Yes! Access to metrics via Terminus is currently available as an alpha command, meaning the command structure may change before full release. [Install Terminus with Git](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installing-with-git){.external} to run bleeding edge version of Terminus to get early access to the `terminus alpha:metrics` command.
