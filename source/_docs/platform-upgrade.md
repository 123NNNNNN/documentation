Pantheonâ€™s multi-tenant platform uses containers and runs on top of dedicated infrastructure. To ensure improved performance and security of this infrastructure, it periodically needs maintenance and upgrade.

We at Pantheon, did not build a traditional hosting architecture. That also implies that we do not wait for our technology stack to get outdated. Thus, we constantly challenge ourselves to run our customer sites on the latest and the greatest.

If your site dashboard displays **Upgrade In Progress** message, it means we are ensuring you and your customers are getting additional benefit as a result of our commitment to offer the best.

## FAQs
### What about my site uptime?

We have built enough redundancy to make sure your site visitors will still be able to visit your site while maintenance is in progress. Read High Availability At Pantheon to learn more.

We can ensure you that there will be zero to minimal downtime on your sites.

### Can I access my site dashboard?

You can access your site dashboard and use all those awesome in-built tools.

To experience a smooth interaction with your dashboard and the development tools, we recommend you not to make any code push during maintenance window. The maintenance window can be anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes depending on several factors as volume of your site components (file size, db), time of the day etc.
