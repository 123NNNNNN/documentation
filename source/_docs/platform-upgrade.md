title: Platform Upgrade in Progress
description: Details on the current infrastructure maintenance.
---
Pantheonâ€™s multi-tenant platform uses containers and runs on top of dedicated infrastructure. To ensure improved performance and security of this infrastructure, it periodically needs maintenance and upgrade.

If your site dashboard displays the **This site is currently undergoing maintenance message**, we recommend waiting to make code changes until maintenance completes. The maintenance window can be anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes depending on several factors, including the size of your site components (code, database, files), time of the day, etc.

We have built redundancy and fail-over to ensure your site will be available during maintenance.

Do not hesitate to contact support if you have any additional questions or concerns.
